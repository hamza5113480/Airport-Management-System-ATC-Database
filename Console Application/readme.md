#Procedure
There are 5 files required for the console.

1) The (*_doc.txt) files contain the description of the in built queries and updates/inserts.

2) The console.py file is the main file which contains the logic for connecting to and updating the database on the server.

3) The my_queries.py file is the file containing the function definitions for the in-built queries. We can add more functions to this file to support many more types of queries.

4) The console has 4 options.
	a) Write your own query: We can write SQL statements here to execute the queries on the server and we will be shown the results and errors (if any). This is as per the annexure-A of the project guideline pdf.
	b) Queries: The user can input query parameter to some queries we have designed.
	c) Updates: The user can input update parameter to some update scenarios we have designed.
	d) Insert: To insert data to some table
	
	Note: Options b, c, and d can also be done through option a if the user knows SQL.
